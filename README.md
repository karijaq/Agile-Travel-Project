Reflections on my Software Development Experience:

* How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

	Interpreting user needs relies heavily on efficiently gathering feedback from users. This 
	can be done in several ways, including interviews, discussion sessions, etc. Creating “user 	stories” contributes to interpreting user needs as these stories define the needs into 
	specific tasks that describe the functionality the user desires. User stories make it easier 	to prioritize features so that the program meets requirements.

* How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

	My approach to program development involves planning, coding and testing. In the future, 	I hope to get more opportunities to use Scrum, as its focus on collaboration and its 
	flexibility allow for continuous improvement.

* What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
	
	Being a good team member in software development means being a collaborator,
	communicator, and supporter. A good team member shares knowledge and contributes to 	a positive work environment. A good team member is also accountable, responsible, 
	respectful, and overall a good collaborator.
